## 1. Why Great PMs Matter
- Great PMs act as **leverage multipliers**: they align teams, focus on outcomes, and ensure that engineering/design effort solves real customer problems.  
- A weak PM can create confusion, waste time, and sink morale.  
- Hiring PMs is one of the most critical decisions for a product organization.

## 2. Common Misconceptions About PMs
- **PM ≠ Project Manager** → It’s not about Gantt charts and timelines.  
- **PM ≠ CEO of the Product** → PMs don’t have direct authority over teams, they lead by influence.  
- **PM ≠ Requirements Clerk** → Their role is not just writing specs or collecting requests.  
- Instead, the PM is responsible for the **“what” and “why”**, while engineering owns the “how.”

## 3. What to Look for in a PM
Ken Norton suggests focusing less on credentials and more on **traits and behaviors**:  
- **Intellectual curiosity** → constantly asking “why” until they reach root causes.  
- **Empathy** → deeply understanding users’ pain points and context.  
- **Strong communication** → able to translate between engineers, designers, executives, and customers.  
- **Technical literacy** → not necessarily coding daily, but understanding trade-offs and systems.  
- **Product sense** → intuition for what makes a product useful, delightful, and successful.

## 4. Red Flags in Hiring PMs
- Candidates who only talk about “managing” people instead of solving customer problems.  
- Lack of data-driven decision-making or weak analytical skills.  
- Ego-driven personalities who create friction rather than collaboration.  
- Over-focus on outputs (features shipped) instead of outcomes (customer value delivered).  

---

## 5. Advice for Aspiring PMs
- **Build things** → side projects, startups, or community initiatives count.  
- **Tell stories with data** → combine metrics with customer narratives.  
- **Develop design taste** → recognize good UX and usability patterns.  
- **Remember outcomes > outputs** → success is measured by customer adoption and business impact.  

---

## 📝 Summary
- Hiring PMs is about finding **influential, empathetic problem-solvers**, not mini-CEOs or project managers.  
- The best PMs bridge customers, business, and technology seamlessly.  
- As an aspiring PM, focus on **building, learning, and demonstrating product thinking** in everything you do.
