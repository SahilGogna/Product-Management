This document summarizes the journey of building **MyStrivera**, focusing on identifying community problems, prioritizing features, addressing challenges, and measuring impact. It also highlights the role of Product Management in shaping the platform.

## Question 1: Identifying Problems

**When you were building MyStrivera, how did you go about identifying the main problems or pain points your community members faced? Did you use any particular methods like surveys, interviews, or maybe just informal chats to understand their needs?**

### Reflection – Identifying Problems (Answer)

When building MyStrivera, I identified key problems by initially sharing my own job search journey on Instagram and YouTube. As I talked about the challenges I faced as an international student and newcomer to the industry, I built a community of over 200,000 followers across social platforms. Through one-on-one calls, informal chats, and direct mentoring sessions, people shared their struggles—like resume reviews, interview prep, and job market confusion. These conversations were like “customer interviews” that helped me pinpoint that job seekers needed a supportive, mentorship-driven community. That realization led to creating MyStrivera.

## Question 2: Prioritizing Features

**Once you had a clear understanding of the problems your community members faced, how did you decide which features or initiatives to prioritize first for MyStrivera? For example, did you use any particular framework (like MoSCoW or RICE), or did you rely on feedback or intuition to figure out what to build or launch first?**

### Reflection – Prioritizing Features (Answer)

To prioritize features for MyStrivera, I relied heavily on the feedback from my community members. During my one-on-one calls and informal interviews, I asked them directly which core feature or service they needed most. While I didn’t use a formal framework like MoSCoW or RICE, I gave them a few options and noticed that most people wanted one-on-one mentorship first, followed by a community space. I also used my own market understanding, imagining what I would have needed as a job seeker. Initially, we launched a structured data analytics program with industry mentors, which got a good response but was hard to scale. Eventually, the feedback showed that a community-focused approach was more valuable, and that’s how we pivoted from a course-based model to a community-driven platform.

## Question 3: Challenges & PM Value

**As you were evolving MyStrivera from a course-based approach to a community-driven platform, what were some of the biggest challenges or mistakes you encountered that you think a dedicated Product Manager might have helped address more smoothly? For example, were there any specific pain points in scaling, communication, or feature validation that stood out?**

### Reflection – Challenges & PM Value (Answer)

One of the biggest turning points was when my co-founder, who had strong product management experience from Google, stepped in. He helped us research and define what kind of community features would best serve our users. Through this collaboration, we realized that the core offerings should revolve around one-on-one mentorship and a supportive peer-driven space. His PM approach helped us move from a purely course-based model to a more dynamic community model. We identified the need for weekly group sessions and themed Friday sessions featuring industry professionals. Without his structured product mindset, we might have struggled to scale these ideas or validate them efficiently.

## Question 4: Measuring Impact

**Reflecting on your journey with MyStrivera, how did you measure whether the changes you made (like moving to a community model or adding mentorship features) were actually successful? Did you track any specific metrics or use any particular methods to understand the impact on your users?**

### Reflection – Measuring Impact (Answer)

When it came to measuring the impact of our shift to a community-driven model, we primarily focused on the number of leads we received. While we didn’t have a structured set of product metrics at first, we noticed a significant increase in interest once we introduced the community-based approach. Within just three months, we went from a modest number of leads to over 700. We also implemented a shortlisting process to ensure the community remained high-quality and aligned with our core values. In essence, the growing number of qualified applicants became our key measure of success and showed that the new model was resonating with our audience.

- Define and validate features before scaling.  
- Shift from a course-based model to a sustainable community-driven approach.  
- Introduce weekly and themed sessions that provided consistent value.  
- Keep the platform aligned with user needs through continuous feedback.  

In short, Product Management helped us **move faster, scale smarter, and serve our community better**.
