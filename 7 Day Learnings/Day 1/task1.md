## Chapter 2 ‚Äì Product Management vs. Product Marketing
- **Product Management (PM)** and **Product Marketing (PMM)** are distinct but complementary.  
- **PM**:  
  - Focuses on building the right product.  
  - Works with design & engineering to define features, roadmap, and priorities.  
  - Deeply understands customer needs and pain points.  
- **PMM**:  
  - Focuses on how to position and sell the product.  
  - Owns messaging, competitive analysis, and launch activities.  
  - Ensures the market understands the product‚Äôs value.  
- Both roles need to collaborate closely, but confusing them often leads to gaps: a great product with poor adoption, or great marketing for a weak product.

## Chapter 3 ‚Äì Product Management vs. Project Management
- **Product Management** and **Project Management** are often mixed up but serve different goals.  
- **PM (Product Management):**  
  - Owns *what* gets built and *why*.  
  - Measures success via product outcomes (adoption, revenue, engagement).  
  - Balances customer needs with business goals.  
- **Project Management:**  
  - Owns *how* and *when* work gets delivered.  
  - Ensures teams stay on schedule, budget, and scope.  
  - Focuses on efficiency and risk management.  
- A product can be delivered on time (project success) but still fail in the market (product failure).  
- Strong organizations ensure **product managers focus on outcomes** while **project managers focus on execution logistics**.

## üìù Summary
- PMs are responsible for **product success, not just delivery**.  
- Product Management is **different from Product Marketing** (messaging/selling) and **Project Management** (timelines/process).  
- Clear role separation allows each function to excel and ensures products are **valuable, usable, and feasible**.
