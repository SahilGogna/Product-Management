# 📚 Product Management Learning Repository

Welcome to my **Product Management learning repository** 👋  

This repo documents my structured learning journey in **Product Management**.  
I’m capturing **daily learnings, tasks, reflections, and curated resources** as I continue to build my PM skills.  

The idea is simple: **learn → reflect → document → share**.

- Each **folder = a learning sprint** (e.g., *7 Day Learnings*).  
- Inside, you’ll find **daily folders** with resources and tasks.  
- Over time, I’ll keep adding more structured PM learnings here.
